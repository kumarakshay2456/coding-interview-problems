    You are designing a system for a parking lot.

	â€¢	Each car enters at some hour start_time and leaves at end_time.
	â€¢	Both start_time and end_time are inclusive, meaning the car is present during both of those hours.
	â€¢	You are given N parking tickets, where each ticket is represented as an interval [start_time, end_time].
	â€¢	You are also given a maximum observation time M (in hours).

    Your task is to determine how many cars are present in the parking lot at each hour from 1 to M.

    ðŸ”¹ Input

        â€¢	tickets: A list of intervals, where each interval [start, end] represents the time a car was parked.
        â€¢	M: An integer, the maximum number of hours to observe.
        tickets = [[4, 5], [1, 3], [2, 6]]
        M = 8 

    ðŸ”¹ Output
  
        [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0]
        Explanation:

            â€¢	Hour 1 â†’ Car [1,3] â†’ 1 car
            â€¢	Hour 2 â†’ Cars [1,3], [2,6] â†’ 2 cars
            â€¢	Hour 3 â†’ Cars [1,3], [2,6] â†’ 2 cars
            â€¢	Hour 4 â†’ Cars [4,5], [2,6] â†’ 2 car
            â€¢	Hour 5 â†’ Car [4,5], [2,6] â†’ 2 car
            â€¢	Hour 6 â†’ Car [2,6] â†’ 1 car
            â€¢	Hours 7 & 8 â†’ No cars

	â€¢	A list of length M, where the i-th element represents the number of cars present in the parking lot at hour i.
    Time Complexity:
	â€¢	Marking changes = O(N)
	â€¢	Prefix sum over hours = O(M)
	â€¢	âœ… Total = O(N + M)
	â€¢	Space Complexity:
	â€¢	Difference array = O(M)
	â€¢	Result array = O(M)
	â€¢	âœ… Total = O(M)
